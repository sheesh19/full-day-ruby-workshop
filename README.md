# Welcome to the Full Day Ruby Workshop! ðŸ’Ž


Solve the following challenges with your workshop buddy (pair programming).

Here are the [Slides with Examples](https://bit.ly/2XVdfpl)

Cheatsheet for [Mac & Linux Users](https://www.slideshare.net/paalringstad/command-cheatsheets-mac)

Cheatsheet for [Windows Users](https://www.slideshare.net/paalringstad/command-cheatsheets-windows-138186563)


You can either use an online tool: 
Use the online Ruby compiler [here](https://repl.it/languages/ruby)

OR

If you have downloaded a text editor like [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) & downloaded Ruby you can: 

1. Create a new file <example_name.rb>
2. Run your ruby file from your terminal with "ruby <example_name.rb>"

### Section 1 | Data Types & Variables

---

**Challenge 1 - Integers**


Create a new variable. Assign it to an integer. 
Create another variable. Assign it to another integer. 
Print out the results of the following: 
1. Add the two variables together
2. Subtract one variable from the other
3. Multiply the two variables together
4. Divide one variable from the other


**Challenge 2 - Strings & Concatenation**


Create a new variable. Assign it a string value. 
Create another variable. Assign it to another string value. 
Concatenate (add) the two strings together. Should there be a space between the two strings? If so, add in the space as well.


**Challenge 3 - Strings & Interpolation**


Create a new variable called `name` which is assigned to your own name.  
Print out a string that says `Hello, your_name - welcome to coding!` . Replace `your_name` with the variable `name` via interpolation (i.e. `#{variable_placed_here}`).


**Challenge 4 - Arrays**


Create a new variable.
Assign your variable to an array full of animals. Have at least 4 animals in your array. 
Add another item into your array. Use the `<<` syntax. 
Add another item into your array. Use the `+` syntax.


**Challenge 5 - Arrays & Indices**


Use the array below:

`students = ["Draco", "Harry", "Hermione", "Frodo", "Samwise"]`

1. Print out the first student of this array.
2. Print out the third student of this array. 


**Challenge 6 - Arrays & Values**


`students = ["Draco", "Harry", "Hermione", "Frodo", "Samwise"]`

Print out the first letter of the first element of this array. 

---

### Section 2 | Conditionals, Loops, & Iterators

---

**Challenge 7 - Conditionals**

`students = ["Draco", "Harry", "Hermione", "Frodo", "Samwise"]`

Print out the second element of the array, but only after having checked if it starts with an "H". Use an if statement.


**Challenge 8 - Loops & Each Iterator**

`students = ["Draco", "Harry", "Hermione", "Frodo", "Samwise"]`

1. Print out all names in this array using `for`.
2. Print out all the names in this array using `while`.
3. Print out all the names in this array using `each`.



**Challenge 9 - Conditionals & Iterators**

`students = ["Draco", "Harry", "Hermione", "Frodo", "Samwise"]`

Time to combine everything you learned! Print out all names that start with an "H". You must use an `each` loop and an if statement.
