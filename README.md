### Section 1 | Data Types & Variables

**Challenge 1 - Integers**

Create a new variable. Assign it to an integer. 
Create another variable. Assign it to another integer. 
Print out the results of the following: 
1. Add the two variables together
2. Subtract one variable from the other
3. Multiply the two variables together
4. Divide one variable from the other

**Challenge 2 - Strings & Concatenation**

Create a new variable. Assign it a string value. 
Create another variable. Assign it to another string value. 
Concatenate (add) the two strings together. Should there be a space between the two strings? If so, add in the space as well.

**Challenge 3 - Strings & Interpolation**

Create a new variable called `name` which is assigned to your own name.  
Print out a string that says `Hello, your_name - welcome to coding!` . Replace `your_name` with the variable `name` via interpolation (i.e. `#{variable_placed_here}`).

`students = ["Draco", "Harry", "Hermione", "Luna"]`

1. Print out the first student of this array.
2. Print out the third student of this array.
